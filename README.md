# The Voidness

![image](https://github.com/shriyabidani/rating-sci-fi-and-horror-games/assets/145644455/11341003-100b-4dc3-ac8e-e7a0060ce475)

## About
*The Voidness* is not only a sci-fi game, but also includes elements of psychological horror. The setting is "a void filled with just gloom and darkness," meaning the surroundings are completely black. In order to "see," the player uses a scanner device to partially illuminate the area with small particles of light, with an effect similar to that of spray paint. The main character of this game, space specialist *Francesca Lee*, awakes after recovering from an injury to find the rest of her teammates have left the base, escaping an "infection" from the void. Lee follows in their footsteps to reach a secondary base in hopes of reuniting with her team. Because the game takes place in almost complete darkness with the ability to only make out outlines of silhouettes, the player's own mind is turned against them, and most of the suspense is built up by the narration of our main character, and the player's own imagination. 

### Unique Elements
Besides the light scanning mechanic, the game also has an optional feature that requires you to hold your breath as the main character hides from the creatures of the void. Breathing too loudly will alert the creatures of your presence, allowing them to find and kill you.

## About: 
*Dead Space* is another sci-fi horror game based in space. It follows our main character, *Isaac Clarke*, who joined a search and rescue team for the USG Ishimura after it went silent in hopes of finding his girlfriend, Nicole Brennan. Once aboard, the team finds the damaged ship to be overrun with Necromorphs. They refocus their mission to looking for survivors and escaping the ship. The game provides an engaging plotline surrounding cult activities that cause the appearance of the Necromorphs, and is an amazing game for fans of the *Berserker Hypothesis* which states that we have not yet encountered alien life because life is being systematically destroyed throughout the universe by [Von Neumann Probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes).

## About
In *Event [0]*, our main character is an explorer selected by the International Transport Spacelines (ITS) to embark on a mission from Earth to Europa. The main character wakes up to realize they have been ejected from the ship in a capsule, which they then guide into a 1980s commercial vessel that was adrift nearby. The main character communicates with the ship's computer to unlock the various passages and rooms in order to find out what happened to the crew of this commercial ship, and go back home to Earth. The game is entirely based on exploring surroundings while communicating with a computer, and the player is free to ask anything they want.

# Midnight Scenes: From the Woods

## About
*Midnight Scenes: From the Woods* is the sequel to *Midnight Scenes: The Nanny*. It takes place in a mental health institution for young men, where mysterious and terrifying things begin happening following the arrival of a new boy, *Oliver*, who went missing with his sister 10 years ago. The story follows *Elijah*, another boy at the center, as he attempts to get close to Oliver and learn about his past, and the cause of the present killings. Although this is technically a horror game, it is very warm, wholesome, and cute (ignoring the fact that people lose eyes) and generally is a feel-good game.
