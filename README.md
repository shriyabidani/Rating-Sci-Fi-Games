    <heading3> About </heading3>
      <p> 
        <em>The Voidness<em> is not only a sci-fi game, but also includes elements of psychological horror. The setting is "a void filled with just gloom and darkness," 
        meaning the surroundings are completely black. In order to "see," the player uses a scanner device to partially illuminate the area with small particles of light, 
        with an effect similar to that of spray-painting. The main character of this game, space specialist <em> Francesca Lee </em>, awakes after recovering from an injury 
        to find the rest of her teammates have left the base, escaping an "infection" from the void. Lee follows in their footsteps to reach a secondary base in hopes of 
        reuiniting with her team. Because the game takes place in almost complete darkness with the ability to only make out outlines of silhouettes, the player's own mind is 
        turned against them, and most of the suspense is built up by the narration of our main character, and the player's own imagination.

      <heading4> Unique Elements </heading4>
      Besides the light scanning mechanic, the game also has an optional feature that requires you to hold your breath as the main character hides from the creatures of the 
      void. Breathing too loudly will alert the creatures of your presence, allowing them to find and kill you.
